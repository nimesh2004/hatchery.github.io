        <h2>Killed for meat and shells</h2><br>
        <p> Marine turtles are killed for their meat in many countries. In Sri Lanka, slaughter of marine turtles for
            meat is a traditional practice in many coastal areas. Slaughter of nesting adult females directly effects
            the reduction of the turtle population. Live turtles entangled in fishing gears are also slaughtered by for
            flesh by the fishermen.
            The highly endangered Hawksbill turtles have been killed in many parts of the world for its beautiful shell
            or carapace to provide raw material for the ‘’tortoise shell’’ trade. When scutes are removed from the
            shell, the turtle eventually dies. Synthetic fibres with similar colour patterns are now available to
            replace the tortoiseshell dies. Synthetic fibres with similar colour patterns are now available to replace
            the tortoiseshell raw materials for the good sake of hawksbill turtles.</p>

                <h3>Consequences</h3>
                <p>Killing turtles for their meat and shells may have serious detrimental effects on the ecosystem as
                    well as the turtles themselves. It may cause the turtle population to fall, breeding cycles to be
                    disturbed, genetic diversity to be lost, and even the possibility of an endangered or vulnerable
                    status. As they are essential to sustaining the health of freshwater and marine environments,
                    shooting turtles can also have an ecological impact. Due to dangerous germs and viruses, eating
                    turtle flesh can also be dangerous for the general public's health.</p>

                <h3>How we can prevent it </h3><br>
                <p>In order to prevent the harvesting of turtle meat and eggs, goverments and other conservatives could
                    educate the public about the ecological value of turtles and implement strict penalties for those
                    who are caught engaging in illegal hunting or trade of turtle products. Forthermore they could
                    educate them on not only why but how they can contribute to the conservation of turtles.</p><br>

        <h2>Habitat distruction</h2><br>
        <p>Sea turtles are dependent on beaches for nesting. Uncontrolled coastal development, vehicle traffic on
            beaches, and other human activities have directly destroyed or disturbed sea turtle nesting beaches around
            the world. For example, lights from roads and buildings disorient hatchlings away from the sea, and vehicle
            traffic on beaches compacts the sand, making it impossible for female turtles to dig nests. Turtle feeding
            grounds such as coral reefs and seagrass beds are damaged and destroyed by activities onshore, including
            sedimentation from clearing of land and nutrient run-off from agriculture. Beach restoration projects for
            protecting seaside buildings have also been found to be harmful, through dredging and sand filling.</p>

                <h3>Consequences</h3>
                <p> Habitat loss can  lead to turtle population fragmentation, which reduces genetic variety among
                    populations and makes them more vulnerable to illness and other dangers. Furthermore, habitat
                    degradation can alter turtles' normal habits, such as breeding cycles, significantly impacting
                    hatchling survival. Finally, habitat loss and degradation pose serious dangers to turtle
                    populations' long-term existence.</p>

                <h3>How we can prevent it</h3>
                <p>in order to conserve the turtle habitat governments should restrict human activities in coastal areas
                    that directly affect turtle nesting and foraging habitats. Furthermore, governments should limit or
                    prohibit coastal constructions such as ports, and coastal tourism infrastructure. This can lead to
                    water and soil pollution, which can destroy the sensitive marine ecosystems that turtles depend on.

        <h2>Pollution</h2><br>
        <p>Sea turtles can mistake floating plastic materials for jellyfish and can choke on them when they try to eat
            them. These encounters are often fatal. Lost or discarded fishing gear—called ghost gear—entangles sea
            turtles and can drown or render a turtle unable to feed or swim. Trash on beaches can trap hatchlings and
            prevent them from reaching the ocean. Oil spills also poison sea turtles of all ages.</p>

            <div id="pollution-con">
                <h3>Consequences</h3>
                 <p>  Eating plastic debris can cause blockages in their digestive system or lead to toxic buildup in
                    their bodies. Pollution can cause respiratory issues, skin irritation, and eye infections in
                    turtles, resulting in decreased health and reproductive success. Pollution's indirect impacts on
                    turtles include a decline in food supplies owing to the buildup of contaminants in their prey or the
                    destruction of their environment.</p>

                <h3>How to prevent it</h3>
                <p>we can reduce the sea pollution by implementing laws that restrict people from taking littering any
                    materials into the sea or on beaches. Furthermore, beach cleanup programs and public awareness
                    campaigns can also be helpful in reducing sea pollution.</p>
