    <h1 id="heading">Overview</h1>
    <p>The Kosgoda Sea Turtle Conservation Project was started by Dudley Perera in the year 1981. The main aim of the project is to conserve the sea turtles and protect them from predators like birds, dogs, and crabs. It is one of the 18 hatcheries in Sri Lanka devoted to the proper breeding of this endangered species. Visitors can get to see up to five endangered species out of seven species of margin turtles in the world here. The place is especially suitable for kids but provides to be a once in a lifetime experience for all.</p>

        <h2>Night patrol </h2>
        <p>The volunteers patrol the beach at night to make sure that any mother turtles have proper conditions to lay eggs. They also carry the eggs back to the hatchery to make sure they hatch properly without any harm from predators and then release the baby sea turtles back into the ocean once properly hatched. They also take care of sea turtles with disabilities and treat the ones who have become weak due to fishing activities.</p>

        <h1 id="heading">The hatchery works in the following steps: </h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Staff patrols beach at nights looking for mother sea turtles that come out of the sea to lay eggs.</li>
            <li>They protect the mother from afar during the nesting process, until she finishes laying the eggs and returns to the ocean.</li>
            <li>The eggs are relocated from beach to hatchery to protect them from predators and irresponsible human action.</li>
            <li>In addition fishermen are also paid to bring any turtle eggs they find to the hatchery.</li>
            <li>The eggs develop and hatch in a protected area. This may take between 45-60 days.</li> 
        </ul>
